Hardware Monitor
----------------

Hardware Monitor is a monitor applet for the Gnome panel. It supports
a variety of monitoring capabilities (CPU usage, network throughput
etc.) and different kinds of viewers (curves, bars, columns, text,
flames).

It is licensed under the GNU GPL.


Requirements
------------

You need a modern Gnome desktop (i.e. at least Gnome 2.6) with the
related libraries and the C++ wrappers for GTK+ and Gnome libraries,
gtkmm and gnomemm (more specifically gtkmm, gconfmm and libglademm).
These can be fetched from http://www.gtkmm.org, or are alternatively
probably available as packages from your distributor.

Also, to compile the program you need the development files for the
Gnome panel-applet library and libgtop.

If you have libsensors from the lm-sensors package installed at
compile time, the configure script will detect it and add support for
monitoring temperatures and fan speeds (if the library is not found,
the relevant UI is hidden).


Compiling from source
---------------------

Note that when you compile from source, the file
HardwareMonitor.server must end up a place where the panel can find
it. Else you will not be able to find the applet in the right-click
panel menu. This place is usually /usr/lib/bonobo/servers/. If you run
configure with 

  ./configure --prefix=/usr

and install the applet, it will most likely work.
