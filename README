Hardware Monitor
----------------

Hardware Monitor is a monitor applet for the XFCE4 panel (originally
the GNOME panel). It supports a variety of monitoring capabilities
(CPU usage, network throughput etc.) and different kinds of viewers
(curves, bars, columns, text, flames).

It is licensed under the GNU GPL.


Requirements
------------

You need a modern XFCE4 desktop (i.e. at least XFCE 4.4 I think) with
the related libraries and the C++ wrappers for GTK+ and the Gnome
canvas library - gtkmm, libglademm and libgnomecanvasmm.
These can be fetched from http://www.gtkmm.org, or are alternatively
probably available as packages from your distributor.

Also, to compile the program you need the development files for the
XFCE4 panel, the XFCE4 user interface library libgtop. The following
are the correct packages on Debian Testing as of 7.11.13:

libglademm-2.4-dev libgnomecanvasmm-2.6-dev libgtkmm-2.4-dev libgtop2-dev
libxfce4ui-1-dev xfce4-panel-dev

If you have libsensors from the lm-sensors package installed at
compile time, the configure script will detect it and add support for
monitoring temperatures and fan speeds (if the library is not found,
the relevant UI is hidden).


Compiling from source
---------------------

Note that when you compile from source, the file
hardware-monitor.desktop must end up a place where the panel can find
it. Else you will not be able to find the applet in the right-click
panel menu. This place is usually /usr/share/xfce4/panel/plugins/. If you
run configure with 

  ./configure --prefix=/usr

and install the applet, it will most likely work.

To set up the build environment for the usual ./configure && make &&
make install, run the provided autogen.sh script first.
