Version 1.4.6 (2014-10-24)
--------------------------

This is mainly a release to get the project properly Debian-packaged,
there is little to no improvement for a normal user.

UNFORTUNATELY THIS INCLUDES A BREAKING CHANGE - the project has been
renamed from hardware-monitor to xfce4-hardware-monitor-plugin, meaning
that your current configuration will not automatically apply to the
upgraded plugin - i.e. all plugin instances will disappear from the panel
the next time you login to XFCE4.

To prevent this from happening, please run the
'1.4.6-upgrade-fix-xfce4-config.bash' script in this project's root
directory after upgrading and before logging out/shutting down.

Version 1.4.5 (2014-07-25)
--------------------------

CPU usage monitor now has a fixed max value of 100% usage - output
is no longer scaled to a changing maximum value - this allows for a
regular CPU graph
Curve monitor now uses the maximum value in its data history (which
spans the visible line) to determine the graph maximum - there is no
longer a gradual decay from some previous maximum. This allows for a
normal network bandwidth graph to be configured - useful scale at
all times, and the line is not clipped
Text monitor font customisation no longer overwritten on preferences
dialog display or startup - thanks to ShapeShifter499 for bug report

Version 1.4.4 (2013-11-07)
--------------------------

Port to XFCE4.
Added myself (OmegaPhil@startmail.com) as maintainer
for this version. 

Version 1.4.3 (2010-06-13)
--------------------------

Fix start-up crash with latest GNOME.
Migrate maintenance to Neil Bird <neilbird@src.gmnome.org>

Version 1.4.2 (2009-05-01)
--------------------------

Fix compilation on latest GNOME (patch by Make Auty) and update to
lm-sensors 3.x API (reported by Francisco Pina Martins). There are
also a couple of translation updates.

Version 1.4.1 (2008-11-09)
--------------------------

Bug fixes (with patches from Simon Wenner and Christof Kr√ºger) and
lots of translation updates.


Version 1.4 (2006-01-13)
-----------------------

Added vertical version of the bar viewer with patch from Emmanuel
Rodriguez. Fixed wrong counting of CPU time with new libgtop.
Translation updates.


Version 1.3 (2005-10-09)
------------------------

The applet now takes advantage of the new features in gtkmm 2.6 to
drop the dependency on libgnomemm and libgnomeuimm. A few bugs have
been fixed. Lots of translation updates.


Version 1.2.1 (2005-03-13)
--------------------------

A bug fix release. With lots of translation updates.


Version 1.2 (2004-07-13)
------------------------

The applet has been ported to gtkmm 2.4 and the related gnomemm
libraries.


Version 1.1 (2004-07-10)
------------------------

The monitored devices now automatically choose an appropriate update
interval - hopefully, this will fix the problem with the load average.
The frame around the applet has been removed. Major preferences
clean-up. The max. measured device value is now saved between
sessions, and not decreased during periods of inactivity. Nice value
is now set to 5 instead of 10.


Version 1.0.2 (2004-06-15)
--------------------------

Use block size from libgtop. Fixes wrong disk usage sizes.


Version 1.0.1 (2004-05-27)
--------------------------

Fixed a bug that caused the applet to not be anti-aliased with GTK+
2.4 and fixed a bug so that columns with zero value are not drawn.
Lots of translation updates.


Version 1.0 (2004-03-04)
------------------------

Added an option to show free disk space instead of used. Added support
for monitoring wireless network connections. Fixed an alignment bug
for the text viewer (it was not aligned with the GNOME clock).
Assorted other bug fixes.


Version 0.7 (2003-08-27)
------------------------

Fixed the performance problem with the column diagram viewer. CPU
usage back to zero again now.

Fixed disk usage sometimes reporting the wrong values for disk size.
Made it report disk usage rather than disk free.

The scales of network monitors over the same network interface are now
synchronized (so that e.g. incoming and outgoing data use the same scale).


Version 0.6 (2003-07-24)
------------------------

Added a column diagram viewer like the System Monitor one in
gnome-applets.

Added support for choosing all of the various temperature sensors in
the system. Also added support for monitoring fan speeds with
lm-sensors. Rearranged the UI for choosing a device to monitor to make
room for these changes. 

Fixed a bug related to choosing the swap usage monitor. Really ignore
ignored lm-sensors features. Made the monitors without predetermined
maximum values reduce their maximum gradually.


Version 0.5.1 (2003-06-01)
--------------------------

Fixed bug with missing '#include <cassert>'. Fixed bug with measuring
outgoing data with network load. Fixed the network tooltip to mention
in/out. Added Korean translation.


Version 0.5 (2003-04-24)
------------------------

Made the curve and the bar viewer update themselves continuously
instead of in small jumps. And the bars are broken into little boxes
which look much neater. Fixed some of the issues with the text viewer.

The applet now renices itself to 10 so that it doesn't steal CPU time
from Real Productive Processes.

Code cleanup, taking more advantage of the class hierarchy to reduce
duplicate code.

Fixed a character set bug that made the applet crash when monitoring
CPU temperature.


Version 0.4 (2003-04-15)
------------------------

Added a feature for optionally changing the background color.

Rearranged the preferences window quite heavily, hopefully it is more
user-friendly now.

Fixed a bug with the curve viewer displaying half lines.

Other bug fixes, including build fixes (should now work with GCC 2.95).


Version 0.3 (2003-03-29)
------------------------

Added support for lm-sensors monitoring of CPU temperature if you have
libsensors.

Adding a monitor will now automatically choose a sensible colour for
the monitor.

Minor other UI enhancements.


Version 0.2 (2003-02-03)
------------------------

A couple of minor bug fixes, and a brand-new beautiful flame view.


Version 0.1 (2003-01-31)
------------------------

First public release. Supports bar view, curve view and textual view,
and the various monitors supported by libgtop.
