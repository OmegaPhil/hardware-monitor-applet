	Release 1.4.6

	* This is mainly a release to get the project properly Debian-packaged, there is little to no improvement for a normal user.

	UNFORTUNATELY THIS INCLUDES A BREAKING CHANGE - the project has been renamed from hardware-monitor to xfce4-hardware-monitor-plugin, meaning that your current configuration will not automatically apply to the upgraded plugin - i.e. all plugin instances will disappear from the panel the next time you login to XFCE4.

	To prevent this from happening, please run the  '1.4.6-upgrade-fix-xfce4-config.bash' script in this project's root directory after upgrading and before logging out/shutting down.

	Release 1.4.5

	* CPU usage monitor now has a fixed max value of 100% usage - output
	is no longer scaled to a changing maximum value - this allows for a
	regular CPU graph.
	* Curve monitor now uses the maximum value in its data history (which
	spans the visible line) to determine the graph maximum - there is no
	longer a gradual decay from some previous maximum. This allows for a
	normal network bandwidth graph to be configured - useful scale at
	all times, and the line is not clipped
	* Text monitor font customisation no longer overwritten on preferences
	dialog display or startup - thanks to ShapeShifter499 for bug report
	https://github.com/OmegaPhil/hardware-monitor-applet/issues/6
	* NEWS: released 1.4.5

	* NEWS: Version 0.5.1 released!

2003-04-19  Ole Laursen  <olau@hardworking.dk>

	* src/curve-view.[ch]pp: Smoothed the curve drawing by separating

	two points.
