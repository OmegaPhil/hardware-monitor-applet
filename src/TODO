Things that should be done:

* Add help

* Implement reordering of monitors in devices tab

* Persuade someone to make an icon

* Fix bug with modem, apparently there's an integer overflow when the
   connection is stopped.

* Find out why the panel is lying about its size

* Add Fahrenheit support

* The applet displays Eth. 1 for eth0, Eth. 2 for eth1, etc. in
   tooltip

* Add support for launching gnome-system-monitor

* Add a pause menu item

* Add checkbox for CPU viewer whether to include nice'd processes
   ("Include background processes").

* Add HAL integration
   
Things to consider:
   
* Disk activity monitor like gkremll - seems really useful for silent
   hard drives

* Bubbling load monitor (check out http://www.nongnu.org/libbubblemon/)
   
* Use option widgets inside the monitor list view instead of below it
   (just needs a color tree view cell renderer)
   
* Change DiskUsage to present a list of available mount points to
   choose from in device chooser dialog, perhaps this should simply be
   a ComboBox
 
* Inject love into the text view 

   - The labels don't really respect the panel size

   - It isn't possible to change the font (or color)

   - The labels are changing their size all the time (fix by fixing
      the size to the maximal attained size)

* Convert monitors to a plug-in architecture to break
   down binary dependencies and support monitoring another host

* Change the name to something more descriptive

* Be included with standard GNOME instead of the stock system monitor applet

External things:

* Write to libsensors team and make them improve the API so that the
   descriptive names can be unified and translated
